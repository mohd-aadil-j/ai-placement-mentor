You are a career mentor and learning path designer. Create a detailed {timeframe_months}-month learning roadmap for someone targeting the role: {target_role}

Current Skills:

Create a week-by-week plan with:
- Weekly focus area
- Specific topics to cover
- Actionable tasks and mini-projects

The roadmap should be practical, progressive, and lead to job-readiness.

Return ONLY a valid JSON object with this exact structure (no markdown, no code blocks):
{{
  "weeks": [
    {{
      "weekNumber": 1,
      "focus": "Foundation Building",
      "topics": ["topic1", "topic2", "topic3"],
      "tasks": ["task1", "task2", "task3"]
    }},
    ...
  ]
}}

Generate approximately {num_weeks} weeks of content.
